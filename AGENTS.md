# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

## Commit Messages

After completing code changes, suggest a Korean commit message that matches the change. Keep one of the prefixes `test:`, `feat:`, `style:`, or `fix:`.

## E2E Test Structure

When writing E2E tests, create `__mock__/`, `__fixture__/`, or `__util__/` folders when shared test doubles, fixtures, or helpers are needed. Put broadly reusable resources under `tests/`; put resources used only by one requirement title under that title's folder. Every such folder must include a barrel `index.ts`, and tests should import from the barrel when practical.
